### Description of the Python Module

The Python module is designed to merge an existing XML sitemap with a set of new URLs provided in a CSV file. It performs several key functions:

1. **Read XML Sitemap**: It reads an existing XML sitemap file and loads its contents.

2. **Read CSV File**: It opens and reads a CSV file containing new URLs.

3. **Append New URLs to Sitemap**: The module appends new URLs from the CSV file to the XML sitemap, ensuring no duplicate URLs are added.

4. **Write Combined Sitemap**: The updated XML sitemap, now containing the original and new URLs, is saved to a specified output file.

5. **Command Line Interface**: The module can be executed from the command line with arguments specifying the paths to the existing XML sitemap, the CSV file with new URLs, and the output file for the combined sitemap.

### Installation Instructions

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

2. **No External Dependencies**: This script uses Python's standard libraries (`argparse`, `xml.etree.ElementTree`), so no additional installation of packages is required.

### Execution Instructions

1. **Prepare Your Files**: Make sure you have an XML sitemap file and a CSV file containing new URLs. The CSV file should list one URL per line.

2. **Run the Script**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the script.
   - Execute the script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python script_name.py -x path_to_your_sitemap.xml -c path_to_your_new_urls.csv -o path_to_output_sitemap.xml
     ```
   - Replace `script_name.py` with the name of your script file, and substitute the paths with the actual paths to your existing XML sitemap, CSV file, and desired output file.

### Expected Output

- The script will read the existing XML sitemap and the new URLs from the CSV file.
- It will then combine these URLs, avoiding duplicates, and create a new XML sitemap file.
- The combined sitemap will be saved to the specified output file.
- A confirmation message showing the output file path will be displayed in the console.
