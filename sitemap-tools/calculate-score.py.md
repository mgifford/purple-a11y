# README for Purple A11y Accessibility Summaries Script

## Overview
The Purple A11y Accessibility Summaries Script is designed to parse and aggregate data from accessibility reports generated in CSV format. This script calculates accessibility scores and grades for websites based on criteria such as critical, serious, moderate, and minor accessibility issues. It provides a comprehensive summary of these reports, making it easier to track and understand accessibility performance over time.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python (version 3.x)
- CSV files generated by accessibility scans, following a specific naming convention

### Steps
1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Download the Script**: Download `purple_a11y_summaries.py` to a known directory on your system.

3. **Prepare Data**: Place your CSV files in a directory. These files should be named using a pattern like `{domain}_{date}_axeImpact.csv`, `{domain}_{date}_number_urls.csv`, `{domain}_{date}_wcagConformance.csv`, etc.

## Execution Options

### Basic Usage
To run the script, open a command-line interface and navigate to the directory containing `purple_a11y_summaries.py`.

Execute the script with:
```bash
python purple_a11y_summaries.py
```

### Specifying a Directory
By default, the script looks for CSV files in the current directory. To specify a different directory, use the `-d` or `--directory` option:

```bash
python purple_a11y_summaries.py -d path_to_your_directory
```

Replace `path_to_your_directory` with the path to the directory containing your CSV files.

## Expected Output
- The script reads files ending with `_axeImpact.csv`, `_number_urls.csv`, `_wcagConformance.csv`, `_url.csv`, and `_xpath.csv` in the specified directory.
- It extracts domain and date information from filenames and processes the data within these files.
- The script calculates accessibility scores and grades based on the severity and number of issues found.
- A summary CSV file named `{domain}_{date}_result.csv` is created for each domain, containing the calculated scores, grades, and additional insights.
- The script outputs summary information to the terminal, including the domain, date of the scan, number of URLs scanned, score, grade, and key findings.

## Notes
- Ensure the filenames of your CSV files follow the specified pattern.
- The script calculates scores based on a predefined formula and categorizes them into grades.
- The output files and terminal summaries provide valuable insights for accessibility performance tracking.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
- Verify the Python version (it should be Python 3).
- Ensure the CSV files are correctly named and placed in the specified directory.
- Check the script's output in the terminal for any error messages.

## Conclusion
This script simplifies the process of monitoring website accessibility by aggregating data from various reports into an easily digestible format. It is a valuable tool for organizations looking to improve their web accessibility and comply with standards like WCAG.
